Boxplot

It seems that we have unnormalized data, we should normalized them.

Histogram

We can observe that our data may have been generated from 3 gaussian distributions. Moreover, we can see some outliers on the right.

Features

There are some discrete features : 3, 11, 18, 22, 28, 29, 38, 42, 45, 46, 56, 59, 73, 

In general, we have 3 seperatas cloud points, center in the middle of the x axis, and at 3 different y.

Features where cloud points are not aligned : 2, 16


It seems that we feature 2 and 16, we can choose the right Gaussian function.

1) Check feature 2, if the value in X is < 6 -> First Gaussian, otherwise Gaussian 2 or 3
2) Check feature 16, if the value in X is > 6 -> Third Gaussian, otherwise Gaussian 2.

6 is not the real threshold. It will be defined in a way to minimize misclassified points.


Each continuous features seem to have been generated also from a gaussian distribution


With the correlation between the features and the ouput, we can distinguish some features which
are highly correlated and some where the correlation is near 0. Maybe we can remove them from the model.
